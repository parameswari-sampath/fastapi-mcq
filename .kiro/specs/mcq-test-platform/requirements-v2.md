# Requirements Document - Version 2 (Role-Based Enhancement)

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing MCQ test platform by adding role-based access control with STUDENT and TEACHER roles. All existing APIs (test management and MCQ question management) will be restricted to TEACHER role only. The current system will be extended to support role selection during registration and role-specific functionality. Teachers will continue to have access to all existing test and question management features with role-based authorization, while students will have completely new functionality to view and take tests created by teachers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register with a role selection (STUDENT or TEACHER), so that I can access role-appropriate functionality in the MCQ test platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL require selection of either STUDENT or TEACHER role
2. WHEN a user provides valid email, password, and role THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with the specified role
3. WHEN a user provides an invalid role value THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN a user registers with TEACHER role THEN the system SHALL grant access to all existing test and question management features
5. WHEN a user registers with STUDENT role THEN the system SHALL grant access to student-specific features only

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing or new user, I want to login and receive role information in my authentication token, so that the system can provide role-appropriate access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an access token containing role information
2. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate both authentication and role authorization
3. WHEN a user with STUDENT role attempts to access any existing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL return a forbidden error
4. WHEN a user with TEACHER role accesses existing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow access to all current functionality
5. WHEN the system validates requests THEN all existing APIs (test management and MCQ management) SHALL be restricted to TEACHER role only



### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all existing APIs to be restricted to TEACHER role only, so that students cannot access test and question management functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any existing test management API is accessed THEN the system SHALL require TEACHER role authorization
2. WHEN any existing MCQ question management API is accessed THEN the system SHALL require TEACHER role authorization
3. WHEN a user with STUDENT role attempts to access existing APIs THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403 Forbidden status
4. WHEN existing APIs are accessed by TEACHER role users THEN the system SHALL maintain all current functionality without changes
5. WHEN the system validates existing API access THEN the system SHALL check for both valid authentication and TEACHER role

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based authorization to be enforced consistently across all endpoints, so that the platform maintains proper security boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL verify both authentication and role authorization
2. WHEN role validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP 403 Forbidden status
3. WHEN the system processes role-based requests THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing teacher functionality
4. WHEN the system handles role information THEN the system SHALL include role data in JWT tokens securely
