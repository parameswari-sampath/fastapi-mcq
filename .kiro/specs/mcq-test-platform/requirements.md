# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a FastAPI-based MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) test platform that allows users to authenticate and manage tests with multiple choice questions. The platform provides user authentication via email/password, test creation and management, and MCQ question handling with four options and correct answer tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and authenticate with email and password, so that I can securely access the MCQ test platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account
2. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user provides valid credentials for login THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return an access token
4. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
5. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints without authentication THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create and manage tests, so that I can organize my MCQ questions into structured assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates a test THEN the system SHALL generate a unique test ID automatically
2. WHEN an authenticated user creates a test with a title THEN the system SHALL store the test with the provided title
3. WHEN an authenticated user creates a test without a description THEN the system SHALL set the description to null by default
4. WHEN an authenticated user retrieves their tests THEN the system SHALL return all active (non-deleted) tests associated with that user
5. WHEN an authenticated user updates a test THEN the system SHALL modify the test title and description
6. WHEN an authenticated user soft deletes a test THEN the system SHALL mark the test as deleted without removing it from the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create and manage MCQ questions within tests, so that I can build comprehensive assessments with multiple choice options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates an MCQ question THEN the system SHALL generate a unique question ID automatically
2. WHEN an authenticated user creates an MCQ question THEN the system SHALL require a title and four options
3. WHEN an authenticated user creates an MCQ question THEN the system SHALL require specification of the correct answer (1, 2, 3, or 4)
4. WHEN an authenticated user creates an MCQ question THEN the system SHALL allow an optional description
5. WHEN an authenticated user associates an MCQ question with a test THEN the system SHALL link the question to the specified test
6. WHEN an authenticated user retrieves questions for a test THEN the system SHALL return all active (non-deleted) MCQ questions associated with that test
7. WHEN an authenticated user updates an MCQ question THEN the system SHALL modify the question details while maintaining the test association
8. WHEN an authenticated user soft deletes an MCQ question THEN the system SHALL mark the question as deleted without removing it from the database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to follow RESTful principles and provide proper error handling, so that the platform is reliable and easy to integrate with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN any API endpoint receives invalid data THEN the system SHALL return validation error messages
3. WHEN the system processes requests THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful URL patterns and HTTP methods
4. WHEN the system handles database operations THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling for connection issues
5. WHEN the system processes authentication THEN the system SHALL implement secure password hashing and token management
